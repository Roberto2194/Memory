Disclaimer for the reviewers:

Ideally, inside the BoardPanel (the panel in which the actual game plays out),
there should be a back button that, after pressed, would bring the user back
to the HomePanel (the starting Panel).
I didn't really have time to implement it, but nonetheless, after finishing the game
(i.e. flipping all cards face up), and relaunching the application,
the user is able to replay the very last game played, and see his or her
high score (if better than the 5 already present).
